# TheTheoryOfAll
A formula used to derive any formula. This was derived from e^2 = (m*c^2)^2 + (p*c)^2 where c^2 = a^2 + b^2 where a=space and b=time

The Biber Conjecture: A Superset of Trigonometry without using any Trig functions.
x^2 - (1/y)^2 = 0.5
x^2 + (1/y)^2 = 8
(x^2 - (1/y)^2)^(1/2) = cos(π/4)
x^2 = y^4
Where x ≠ y, and y is a complex form of x.

1 is half way between 0 and π if you apply time dilation to the number line. (based on Lorentz factor)
-1 is half way between 0 and π*i the other way. (based on Lorentz factor)
0 is half way between π and π*i based on Lorentz factor
neither 0 or 1 are real numbers. 
The only real numbers are pi and i*pi.

The number line needs dilated to do this.

When Time = -299792458 + (299792458*I)**(-299792458 + (299792458*I)**(-1 + I**(299792458**pi)*pi))
Space = 299792458 
1 unit of Spacetime = (-299792458 + (299792458*I)**(-299792458 + (299792458*I)**(-1 + I**(299792458**pi)*pi)))/299792458 joules/volume
where volume = (pi^2 + i*pi**2)**(2)
If we multiply both side by 299792458:

-299792458 + (299792458*I)**(-299792458 +
(299792458*I)**(-1 + I**(299792458**pi)*pi)) = 299792458

is the Physical Formula. All formulas are derived from this:
eurler, pythagorean, relativity
c**(1/2) = v + (y*i)**(x + (z*i)**(t + pi*I**(m*s**(pi))))

Mass <-> Space <-> Gravity <-> Time <-> Energy, where:

mass = C*(pi)^E
energy = -C*(pi * i)^E,
Where C=coefficient and E=exponent. This means:
Space = -C*(i*pi)^2 = C*(pi^2) (Emergent. This is the equal signs magnitude)
Time = -C*(i*pi)^2 = C*(pi*2). (Emergent. This is the operators magnitude)
As Space and Time are just inverses of each other. This then means that Gravity is 
Gravity = C*(-C*(i*pi*2) + C*(pi*2))^E 

Mass Emerges when the ratio of Time/Space is not equal and in the favor of Space
Energy Emerges when the ratio Space/Time is not equal and in the favor of Time

If the distance between Space and Time reaches 299792458, The are not observable to each other anymore.
Too much Mass makes seemingly infinite Space
Too much Energy makes seemingly infinite Time

In the code attached in this repo:

everything = TheMathFunction()
All = everything.returnAll()
firstOrder(All[0][0][0], All[0][0][1]) = [8.00000000000000, 0.500000000000000] 
firstOrder(All[0][1][0], All[0][1][1]) = [8.00000000000000, -0.500000000000000]
firstOrder(All[1][0][0], All[1][0][1]) = [0, 2.00000000000000]
firstOrder(All[1][1][0], All[1][1][1]) = [0, 32.0000000000000]
firstOrder(All[2][0][0], All[2][0][1]) = [8.00000000000000, 8.00000000000000]  
firstOrder(All[2][1][0], All[2][1][1]) = [8.00000000000000, -8.00000000000000] 
firstOrder(All[3][0][0], All[3][0][1]) = [0, 32.0000000000000]
firstOrder(All[3][1][0], All[3][1][1]) = [0, 2.00000000000000]
firstOrder(All[4][0][0], All[4][0][1]) = [8.0 + (4 + 4*I)**1.0, 8.0 - (4 + 4*I)**1.0]
firstOrder(All[4][1][0], All[4][1][1]) = [(4 - 4*I)**1.0, -(4 - 4*I)**1.0]
firstOrder(All[5][0][0], All[5][0][1]) = [16.0 + 16.0*I**1.0, 16.0 - 16.0*I**1.0]
firstOrder(All[5][1][0], All[5][1][1]) = [1 + 16.0*(-I)**1.0, 1 - 16.0*(-I)**1.0]

From there, any number can be derived and any algorithim should be derivable. I am still proofing out the algorithim side.
I have derived eulers forumal, pythagorean theroem, special relativity, lorentz contraction, and Ohms law
